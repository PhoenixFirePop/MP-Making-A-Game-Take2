# MP-Making-A-Game-Take2
Attempt 2 - Making a game using a platformer-type concept

Milestone Project - Creating a browser game 

The goal of this project is to create a game from scratch using mainly what we've learned so far. I didnt want to bite off more thatn I could chew, so the concept will be simple and start with simple shapes that can be coded easily, then, when the main code sturcture is set up, I'll go in and change up the graphics to be more on par to what I am hoping for. 

Main idea:
    Platformer - Jumping Upwards to reach goal
Currently working on:
    Adding collision to platforms so character doesnt fall through platforms
